# github-folders
## TODO 
- check if folder already there
- run git fetch
- parameter to get all the folders and their contents currently
- user can specify pattern for folder naming
- handle git log in and stuff, maybe generate ssh keys (since it's a new computer)
- store my auth token somewhere (and add it to .gitignore)
- instead of topic, providing structure in description could be better, like user/group/etc (could also reduce the requests for repos)
additional points in google doc
- get list of repos with no topics
- maybe bash file with autocomplete

## quick links
[github api](https://developer.github.com/v3/)


## Ideas
### group pages
- command to create a repo that will include links to all repos in group (or all the groups)
- also includs .sh (and maybe bat) file to clone all of them ( [updated automatically](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/))
- gets the descriptions and inserts in README.md
- maybe create a file with names and update descriptions for those repos
