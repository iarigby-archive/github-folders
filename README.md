# github-folders
## TODO 
- check if folder already there
- run git fetch
- parameter to get all the folders and their contents currently
- user can specify pattern for folder naming
- handle git log in and stuff, maybe generate ssh keys (since it's a new computer)
- store my auth token somewhere (and add it to .gitignore)
- instead of topic, providing structure in description could be better, like user/group/etc
